Todo list and discussion on development of OCA banking modules for Odoo

For Odoo 7.0 and previous a lot of functionality was developed by the
community for Banking. The core module was account_banking.

For 8.0 and further the community agreed on a big reorganization of the
banking modules. For a start splitting the functionality in three projects:
bank-statement-import
bank-statement-reconcile
bank-payment

The project names speak for themselves.

Also it was decided that the import framework should be compatible and use
that provided by future versions of Odoo.

This project will contain a TODO list of all the work that needs to be done
for the migration, and also there will be room for links, documentation, ideas
etc.

Other users can contribute in the normal github way by providing pull requests,
or ofcourse they can fork an maintain their own list.
